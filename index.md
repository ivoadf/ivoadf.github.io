### About me

I am a curious person, I enjoy exploring and learning about any subject. I never turn down a challenging project and am always open to learn and improve.
Critical thinker at heart, I am always trying to find unique solutions that can be applied to my daily life and to problems I might encounter.

My free time is consumed reading books, watching my favourite youtubers and exercising.

### Education
---
Completed the Integrated Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering in 2018. This degree provided by the Faculty of Engineering at University of Porto had a total length of 5 years. 3 year BSc + 2 year MSc.

#### Master's Thesis
A Deep Learning Approach to Named Entity Recognition in Portuguese Texts. Analyzed, implemented, trained and tested multiple deep learning architectures. Available in [UPortoâ€™s platform](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/pub_geral.pub_view?pi_pub_base_id=277689).

A paper originated from this work and was accepted in the Second International Workshop on Advances in Natural Language Processing (ANLP 2018). The paper is available in [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329396012_Applying_Deep_Neural_Networks_to_Named_Entity_Recognition_in_Portuguese_Texts).
